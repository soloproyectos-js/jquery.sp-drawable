# jquery.sp-drawable

The class `$.spDrawable` represents the base class for any "drawable" object. I would like to note that this library IS NOT a JavaScript library for rendering graphics. For that purpose there are several solutions, as PIXI, FabricJS, etc... A "drawable" class is just an object that can be drawn.
